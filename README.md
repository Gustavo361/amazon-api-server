# Amazon Scraper

## Description
A responsive interface featuring a form, an input field, a button, and a display box. After the user enters and searches a keyword into the input field, the content is sent to a server, which then forwards the keyword to Amazon. Amazon retrieves information such as title, rating, reviews, price, and image, which is then relayed back to the user on the frontend.

The frontend and backend are hosted separately.
